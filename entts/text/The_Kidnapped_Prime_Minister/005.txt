The following morning, Poirot showed me a telegram he had just received. It had no place of origin, and was unsigned.
It ran: "In time."
Later in the day the evening papers published an account of the Allied Conference. They laid particular stress on the magnificent ovation accorded to Mr. David MacAdam, whose inspiring speech had produced a deep and lasting impression.
THE END.
