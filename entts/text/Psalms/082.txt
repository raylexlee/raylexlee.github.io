1 [Psalm Of Asaph] God takes his stand in the divine assembly, surrounded by the gods he gives judgement.
2 'How much longer will you give unjust judgements and uphold the prestige of the wicked?
3 Let the weak and the orphan have justice, be fair to the wretched and the destitute.
4 'Rescue the weak and the needy, save them from the clutches of the wicked.
5 'Ignorant and uncomprehending, they wander in darkness, while the foundations of the world are tottering.
6 I had thought, "Are you gods, are all of you sons of the Most High?"
7 No! you will die as human beings do, as one man, princes, you will fall.'
8 Arise, God, judge the world, for all nations belong to you.
