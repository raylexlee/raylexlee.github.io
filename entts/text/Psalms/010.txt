1 Why, Yahweh, do you keep so distant, stay hidden in times of trouble?
2 In his pride the wicked hunts down the weak, who is caught in the schemes he devises.
3 The wicked is proud of his inmost desires, by his blasphemies the grasping spurns Yahweh,
4 the wicked in his arrogance does not look very far; 'There is no God,' is his only thought.
5 In all circumstances his step is assured; your judgements are above his head. His rivals? He scoffs at them all.
6 He says in his heart, 'I shall never be shaken,' free of trouble himself,
7 he wishes it on others. His speech is full of lies and browbeating, under his tongue lurk spite and wickedness.
8 In the undergrowth he lies in ambush, in his hiding-place he murders the innocent. He watches intently for the downtrodden,
9 lurking unseen like a lion in his lair, lurking to pounce on the poor; he pounces on him and drags him off in his net.
10 He keeps watch, crouching down low, the poor wretch falls into his clutches;
11 he says in his heart, 'God forgets, he has turned away his face to avoid seeing the end.'
12 Rise, Yahweh! God, raise your hand, do not forget the afflicted!
13 Why should the wicked spurn God, assuring himself you will never follow it up?
14 You have seen for yourself the trouble and vexation, you watch so as to take it in hand. The oppressed relies on you; you are the only recourse of the orphan.
15 Break the arm of the wicked and evil, seek out wickedness till there is none left to be found.
16 Yahweh is king for ever and ever, the heathen has vanished from his country.
17 Yahweh, you listen to the laments of the poor, you give them courage, you grant them a hearing,
18 to give judgement for the orphaned and exploited, so that earthborn humans may strike terror no more.
