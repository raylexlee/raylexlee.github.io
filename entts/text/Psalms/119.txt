148 My eyes are awake before each watch of the night, to ponder your promise.
149 In your faithful love, Yahweh, listen to my voice, let your judgements give me life.
150 My pursuers are coming closer to their wicked designs, and further from your Law.
151 You are close to me, Yahweh, and all your commandments are true.
152 Long have I known that your instructions were laid down to last for ever.
153 Look at my suffering and rescue me, for I do not forget your Law.
