1 [Song Psalm Of David] My heart is ready, God, I will sing and make music; come, my glory!
2 Awake, lyre and harp, I will awake the Dawn!
3 I will praise you among the peoples, Yahweh, I will play to you among nations,
4 for your faithful love towers to heaven, and your constancy to the clouds.
5 Be exalted above the heavens, God. Your glory over the whole earth!
6 To rescue those you love, save with your right hand and answer us.
7 God has spoken from his sanctuary, 'In triumph I will divide up Shechem, and share out the Valley of Succoth.
8 'Mine is Gilead, mine Manasseh, Ephraim the helmet on my head, Judah my commander's baton,
9 'Moab a bowl for me to wash in, on Edom I plant my sandal, over Philistia I cry victory.'
10 Who will lead me against a fortified city, who will guide me into Edom,
11 if not you, the God who has rejected us? God, you no longer march with our armies.
12 Bring us help in our time of crisis, any human assistance is worthless.
13 With God we shall do deeds of valour, he will trample down our enemies.
