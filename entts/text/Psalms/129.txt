1 [Song of Ascents] Often as men have attacked me since I was young -- let Israel repeat it-
2 often as men have attacked me since I was young, they have never overcome me.
3 On my back ploughmen have set to work, making long furrows,
4 but Yahweh the upright has shattered the yoke of the wicked.
5 Let all who hate Zion be thrown back in confusion,
6 let them be like grass on a roof, dried up before it is cut,
7 never to fill the reaper's arm nor the binder's lap.
8 And no passer-by will say, 'The blessing of Yahweh be on you! 'We bless you in the name of Yahweh.'
