1 [For the choirmaster For strings Psalm Song] May God show kindness and bless us, and make his face shine on us.
2 Then the earth will acknowledge your ways, and all nations your power to save.
3 Let the nations praise you, God, let all the nations praise you.
4 Let the nations rejoice and sing for joy, for you judge the world with justice, you judge the peoples with fairness, you guide the nations on earth.
5 Let the nations praise you, God, let all the nations praise you.
6 The earth has yielded its produce; God, our God has blessed us.
7 May God continue to bless us, and be revered by the whole wide world.
