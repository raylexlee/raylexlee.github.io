1 [For the choirmaster For strings For the octachord Psalm Of David] Yahweh, let your rebuke to me not be in anger, your punishment not in the heat of wrath.
2 Have pity on me, Yahweh, for I am fading away. Heal me, Yahweh, my bones are shaken,
3 my spirit is shaken to its very depths. But you, Yahweh . . . how long?
4 Yahweh, relent and save my life rescue me because of your faithful love,
5 for in death there is no remembrance of you; who could sing your praises in Sheol?
6 I am worn out with groaning, every night I drench my pillow and soak my bed with tears.
7 My eyes waste away with vexation. Arrogance from all my foes!
8 Away from me, all evil-doers! For Yahweh has heard the sound of my weeping,
9 Yahweh has heard my pleading. Yahweh will accept my prayer.
10 Let all my enemies be put to confusion, shaken to their depths, let them retreat in sudden confusion.
