1 [Of David Psalm] Yahweh declared to my Lord, 'Take your seat at my right hand, till I have made your enemies your footstool.'
2 Yahweh will stretch out the sceptre of your power; from Zion you will rule your foes all around you.
3 Royal dignity has been yours from the day of your birth, sacred honour from the womb, from the dawn of your youth.
4 Yahweh has sworn an oath he will never retract, you are a priest for ever of the order of Melchizedek.
5 At your right hand, Lord, he shatters kings when his anger breaks out.
6 He judges nations, heaping up corpses, he breaks heads over the whole wide world.
7 He drinks from a stream as he goes, and therefore he holds his head high.
