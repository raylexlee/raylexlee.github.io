1 [For the choirmaster Psalm Of David] May Yahweh answer you in time of trouble, may the name of the God of Jacob protect you!
2 May he send you help from the sanctuary, give you support from Zion!
3 May he remember all your sacrifices and delight in your burnt offerings!
4 May he grant you your heart's desire and crown all your plans with success!
5 So that with joy we can hail your victory and draw up our ranks in the name of our God. May Yahweh grant all your petitions.
6 Now I know that Yahweh gives victory to his anointed. He will respond from his holy heavens with great deeds of victory from his right hand.
7 Some call on chariots, some on horses, but we on the name of Yahweh our God.
8 They will crumple and fall, while we stand upright and firm.
9 Yahweh, save the king, answer us when we call.
