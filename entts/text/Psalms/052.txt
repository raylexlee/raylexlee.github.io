1 [For the choirmaster Poem Of David When Doeg the Edomite went and warned Saul, 'David has gone to Abimelech's house'] Why take pride in being wicked, you champion in villainy, all day long
2 plotting crime? Your tongue is razor-sharp, you artist in perfidy.
3 You prefer evil to good, lying to uprightness.
4 You revel in destructive talk, treacherous tongue!
5 That is why God will crush you, destroy you once and for all, snatch you from your tent, uproot you from the land of the living.
6 The upright will be awestruck as they see it, they will mock him,
7 'So much for someone who would not place his reliance in God, but relied on his own great wealth, and made himself strong by crime.'
8 But I, like a flourishing olive tree in the house of God, put my trust in God's faithful love, for ever and ever.
9 I shall praise you for ever for what you have done, and shall trust in your name, so full of goodness, in the presence of your faithful.
