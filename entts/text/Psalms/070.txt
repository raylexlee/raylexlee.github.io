1 [For the choirmaster Of David In commemoration] Be pleased, God, to rescue me, Yahweh, come quickly and help me!
2 Shame and dismay to those who seek my life! Back with them! Let them be humiliated who delight in my misfortunes.
3 Let them shrink away covered with shame, those who say to me, 'Aha, aha!'
4 But joy and happiness in you to all who seek you. Let them ceaselessly cry, 'God is great', who love your saving power.
5 Poor and needy as I am, God, come quickly to me! Yahweh, my helper, my Saviour, do not delay!
