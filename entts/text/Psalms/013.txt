1 [For the choirmaster Psalm Of David] How long, Yahweh, will you forget me? For ever? How long will you turn away your face from me?
2 How long must I nurse rebellion in my soul, sorrow in my heart day and night? How long is the enemy to domineer over me?
3 Look down, answer me, Yahweh my God! Give light to my eyes or I shall fall into the sleep of death.
4 Or my foe will boast, 'I have overpowered him,' and my enemy have the joy of seeing me stumble.
5 As for me, I trust in your faithful love, Yahweh. Let my heart delight in your saving help, let me sing to Yahweh for his generosity to me, let me sing to the name of Yahweh the Most High!
6 But I trust in your mercy, Grant my heart joy in your salvation. I will sing to the Lord, for he has dealt bountifully with me!
