1 [Song of Ascents Of David] If Yahweh had not been on our side -- let Israel repeat it-
2 if Yahweh had not been on our side when people attacked us,
3 they would have swallowed us alive in the heat of their anger.
4 Then water was washing us away, a torrent running right over us;
5 running right over us then were turbulent waters.
6 Blessed be Yahweh for not letting us fall a prey to their teeth!
7 We escaped like a bird from the fowlers' net. The net was broken and we escaped;
8 our help is in the name of Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
