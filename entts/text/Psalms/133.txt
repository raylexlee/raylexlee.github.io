1 [Song of Ascents] How good, how delightful it is to live as brothers all together!
2 It is like a fine oil on the head, running down the beard, running down Aaron's beard, onto the collar of his robes.
3 It is like the dew of Hermon falling on the heights of Zion; for there Yahweh bestows his blessing, everlasting life.
