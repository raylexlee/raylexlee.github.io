1 [For the choirmaster Tune: 'The oppression of distant princes' Of David In a quiet voice When the Philistines seized him in Gath] Take pity on me, God, as they harry me, pressing their attacks home all day.
2 Those who harry me lie in wait for me all day, countless are those who attack me from the heights.
3 When I am afraid, I put my trust in you,
4 in God, whose word I praise, in God I put my trust and have no fear, what power has human strength over me?
5 All day long they carp at my words, their only thought is to harm me,
6 they gather together, lie in wait and spy on my movements, as though determined to take my life.
7 Because of this crime reject them, in your anger, God, strike down the nations.
8 You yourself have counted up my sorrows, collect my tears in your wineskin.
9 Then my enemies will turn back on the day when I call. This I know, that God is on my side.
10 In God whose word I praise, in Yahweh whose word I praise,
11 in God I put my trust and have no fear; what can mortal man do to me?
12 I am bound by the vows I have made, God, I will pay you the debt of thanks,
13 for you have saved my life from death to walk in the presence of God, in the light of the living.
