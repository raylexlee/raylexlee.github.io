1 [For the choirmaster Of the sons of Korah For oboe Song] God is both refuge and strength for us, a help always ready in trouble;
2 so we shall not be afraid though the earth be in turmoil, though mountains tumble into the depths of the sea,
3 and its waters roar and seethe, and the mountains totter as it heaves. (Yahweh Sabaoth is with us, our citadel, the God of Jacob.)
4 There is a river whose streams bring joy to God's city, it sanctifies the dwelling of the Most High.
5 God is in the city, it cannot fall; at break of day God comes to its rescue.
6 Nations are in uproar, kingdoms are tumbling, when he raises his voice the earth crumbles away.
7 Yahweh Sabaoth is with us, our citadel, the God of Jacob.
8 Come, consider the wonders of Yahweh, the astounding deeds he has done on the earth;
9 he puts an end to wars over the whole wide world, he breaks the bow, he snaps the spear, shields he burns in the fire.
10 'Be still and acknowledge that I am God, supreme over nations, supreme over the world.'
11 Yahweh Sabaoth is with us, our citadel, the God of Jacob.
