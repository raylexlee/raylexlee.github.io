1 Yahweh is king, robed in majesty, robed is Yahweh and girded with power.
2 The world is indeed set firm, it can never be shaken; your throne is set firm from of old, from all eternity you exist.
3 The rivers lift up, Yahweh, the rivers lift up their voices, the rivers lift up their thunder.
4 Greater than the voice of many waters, more majestic than the breakers of the sea, Yahweh is majestic in the heights.
5 Your decrees stand firm, unshakeable, holiness is the beauty of your house, Yahweh, for all time to come.
