1 [For the choirmaster . . . Jeduthun Of Asaph Psalm] I cry to God in distress, I cry to God and he hears me.
2 In the day of my distress I sought the Lord; all night I tirelessly stretched out my hands, my heart refused to be consoled.
3 I sigh as I think of God, my spirit faints away as I ponder on him.
4 You kept me from closing my eyes, I was too distraught to speak;
5 I thought of former times, years long past
6 I recalled; through the night I ponder in my heart, as I reflect, my spirit asks this question:
7 Is the Lord's rejection final? Will he never show favour again?
8 Is his faithful love gone for ever? Has his Word come to an end for all time?
9 Does God forget to show mercy? In anger does he shut off his tenderness?
10 And I said, 'This is what wounds me, the right hand of the Most High has lost its strength.'
11 Remembering Yahweh's great deeds, remembering your wonders in the past,
12 I reflect on all that you did, I ponder all your great deeds.
13 God, your ways are holy! What god is as great as our God?
14 You are the God who does marvellous deeds, brought nations to acknowledge your power,
15 with your own arm redeeming your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph.
16 When the waters saw you, God, when the waters saw you they writhed in anguish, the very depths shook with fear.
17 The clouds pelted down water, the sky thundered, your arrows shot back and forth.
18 The rolling of your thunder was heard, your lightning-flashes lit up the world, the earth shuddered and shook.
19 Your way led over the sea, your path over the countless waters, and none could trace your footsteps.
20 You guided your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
