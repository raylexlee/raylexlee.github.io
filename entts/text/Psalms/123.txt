1 [Song of Ascents] I lift up my eyes to you who are enthroned in heaven.
2 Just as the eyes of slaves are on their masters' hand, or the eyes of a slave-girl on the hand of her mistress, so our eyes are on Yahweh our God, for him to take pity on us.
3 Have pity on us, Yahweh, have pity, for we have had our full share of scorn,
4 more than our share of jeers from the complacent. (Scorn is for the proud.)
