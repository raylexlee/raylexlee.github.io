1 [For the choirmaster Of David] The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.' Their deeds are corrupt and vile, not one of them does right.
2 Yahweh looks down from heaven at the children of Adam. To see if a single one is wise, a single one seeks God.
3 All have turned away, all alike turned sour, not one of them does right, not a single one.
4 Are they not aware, all these evil-doers? They are devouring my people, this is the bread they eat, and they never call to Yahweh.
5 They will be gripped with fear, where there is no need for fear, for God takes the side of the upright;
6 you may mock the plans of the poor, but Yahweh is their refuge.
7 Who will bring from Zion salvation for Israel? When Yahweh brings his people home, what joy for Jacob, what happiness for Israel!
