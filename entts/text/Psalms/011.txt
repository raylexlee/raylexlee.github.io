1 [For the choirmaster Of David] In Yahweh I have found refuge. How can you say to me, 'Bird, flee to your mountain?
2 'For look, the wicked are drawing their bows, fitting their arrows to the string to shoot honest men from the shadows.
3 If the foundations fall to ruin, what can the upright do?'
4 Yahweh in his holy temple! Yahweh, his throne is in heaven; his eyes watch over the world, his gaze scrutinises the children of Adam.
5 Yahweh examines the upright and the wicked, the lover of violence he detests.
6 He will rain down red-hot coals, fire and sulphur on the wicked, a scorching wind will be their lot.
7 For Yahweh is upright and loves uprightness, the honest will ever see his face.
