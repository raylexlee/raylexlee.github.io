1 [For the choirmaster For strings Of David] God, hear my cry, listen to my prayer.
2 From the end of the earth I call to you with fainting heart. Lead me to the high rock that stands far out of my reach.
3 For you are my refuge, a strong tower against the enemy.
4 Let me stay in your tent for ever, taking refuge in the shelter of your wings!
5 For you, God, accept my vows, you grant me the heritage of those who fear your name.
6 Let the king live on and on, let his years continue age after age.
7 May his throne be always in God's presence, your faithful love and constancy watch over him.
8 Then I shall always sing to your name, day after day fulfilling my vows.
