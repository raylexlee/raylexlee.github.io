1 Alleluia! Sing a new song to Yahweh: his praise in the assembly of the faithful!
2 Israel shall rejoice in its Maker, the children of Zion delight in their king;
3 they shall dance in praise of his name, play to him on tambourines and harp!
4 For Yahweh loves his people, he will crown the humble with salvation.
5 The faithful exult in glory, shout for joy as they worship him,
6 praising God to the heights with their voices, a two-edged sword in their hands,
7 to wreak vengeance on the nations, punishment on the peoples,
8 to load their kings with chains and their nobles with iron fetters,
9 to execute on them the judgement passed -- to the honour of all his faithful.
