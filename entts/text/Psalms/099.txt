1 Yahweh is king, the peoples tremble; he is enthroned on the winged creatures, the earth shivers;
2 Yahweh is great in Zion. He is supreme over all nations;
3 let them praise your name, great and awesome; holy is he
4 and mighty! You are a king who loves justice, you established honesty, justice and uprightness; in Jacob it is you who are active.
5 Exalt Yahweh our God, bow down at his footstool; holy is he!
6 Moses and Aaron are among his priests, and Samuel, calling on his name; they called on Yahweh and he answered them.
7 He spoke with them in the pillar of fire, they obeyed his decrees, the Law he gave them.
8 Yahweh our God, you answered them, you were a God of forgiveness to them, but punished them for their sins.
9 Exalt Yahweh our God, bow down at his holy mountain; holy is Yahweh our God!
