1 [For the choirmaster Tune: 'Lilies . . .' Of the sons of Korah Poem Love song] My heart is stirred by a noble theme, I address my poem to the king, my tongue the pen of an expert scribe.
2 Of all men you are the most handsome, gracefulness is a dew upon your lips, for God has blessed you for ever.
3 Warrior, strap your sword at your side, in your majesty and splendour advance,
4 ride on in the cause of truth, gentleness and uprightness. Stretch the bowstring tight, lending terror to your right hand.
5 Your arrows are sharp, nations lie at your mercy, the king's enemies lose heart.
6 Your throne is from God, for ever and ever, the sceptre of your kingship a sceptre of justice,
7 you love uprightness and detest evil. This is why God, your God, has anointed you with oil of gladness, as none of your rivals,
8 your robes all myrrh and aloes. From palaces of ivory, harps bring you joy,
9 in your retinue are daughters of kings, the consort at your right hand in gold of Ophir.
10 Listen, my daughter, attend to my words and hear; forget your own nation and your ancestral home,
11 then the king will fall in love with your beauty; he is your lord, bow down before him.
12 The daughter of Tyre will court your favour with gifts, and the richest of peoples
13 with jewels set in gold. Clothed
14 in brocade, the king's daughter is led within to the king with the maidens of her retinue; her companions are brought to her,
15 they enter the king's palace with joy and rejoicing.
16 Instead of your ancestors you will have sons; you will make them rulers over the whole world.
17 I will make your name endure from generation to generation, so nations will sing your praise for ever and ever.
