1 [Song of Ascents *{* The Songs of Ascents (Pss 
120-
134) were sung by pilgrims on their way up to Jerusalem.} ] To Yahweh when I am in trouble I call and he answers me.
2 Yahweh, save me from lying lips and a treacherous tongue!
3 What will he repay you, what more, treacherous tongue?
4 War-arrows made sharp over red-hot charcoal.
5 How wretched I am, living in Meshech, dwelling in the tents of Kedar!
6 Too long have I lived among people who hate peace.
7 When I speak of peace they are all for war!
