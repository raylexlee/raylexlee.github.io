1 [For the choirmaster For strings Psalm Of Asaph Song] God is acknowledged in Judah, his name is great in Israel,
2 his tent is pitched in Salem, his dwelling is in Zion;
3 there he has broken the lightning-flashes of the bow, shield and sword and war.
4 Radiant you are, and renowned for the mountains of booty
5 taken from them. Heroes are now sleeping their last sleep, the warriors' arms have failed them;
6 at your reproof, God of Jacob, chariot and horse stand stunned.
7 You, you alone, strike terror! Who can hold his ground in your presence when your anger strikes?
8 From heaven your verdicts thunder, the earth is silent with dread
9 when God takes his stand to give judgement, to save all the humble of the earth.
10 Human anger serves only to praise you, the survivors of your anger will huddle round you.
11 Make and fulfil your vows to Yahweh your God, let those who surround him make offerings to the Awesome One.
12 He cuts short the breath of princes, strikes terror in earthly kings.
