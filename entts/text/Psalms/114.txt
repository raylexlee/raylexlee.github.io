1 Alleluia! When Israel came out of Egypt, the House of Jacob from a people of foreign speech,
2 Judah became his sanctuary, and Israel his domain.
3 The sea fled at the sight, the Jordan turned back,
4 the mountains skipped like rams, the hills like sheep.
5 Sea, what makes you flee? Jordan, why turn back?
6 Why skip like rams, you mountains? Why like sheep, you hills?
7 Tremble, earth, at the coming of the Lord, at the coming of the God of Jacob,
8 who turns rock into pool, flint into fountain.
