1 Alleluia! Praise God in his holy place, praise him in the heavenly vault of his power,
2 praise him for his mighty deeds, praise him for all his greatness.
3 Praise him with fanfare of trumpet, praise him with harp and lyre,
4 praise him with tambourines and dancing, praise him with strings and pipes,
5 praise him with the clamour of cymbals, praise him with triumphant cymbals,
6 Let everything that breathes praise Yahweh. Alleluia!
