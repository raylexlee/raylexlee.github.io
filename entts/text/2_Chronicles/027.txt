1 Jotham was twenty-five years old when he came to the throne and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerushah daughter of Zadok.
2 He did what Yahweh regards as right, just as his father Uzziah had done. Only he did not enter Yahweh's sanctuary. But the people continued to do wrong.
3 It was he who built the Upper Gate of the Temple of Yahweh and carried out considerable work on the wall of the Ophel.
4 He also built towns in the highlands of Judah and built forts and towers in the wooded areas.
5 He also went to war against the king of the Ammonites and defeated them; and the Ammonites had to give him a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand kor of wheat and ten thousand of barley that year. And the Ammonites paid him the same amount, the second and third years afterwords. 
6 Jotham became powerful because he kept an unswerving course before Yahweh his God.
7 The rest of the history of Jotham, all his wars and his policy, are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
8 He was twenty-five years old when he came to the throne and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem.
9 Then Jotham fell asleep with his ancestors, and was buried in the City of David; his son Ahaz succeeded him.
