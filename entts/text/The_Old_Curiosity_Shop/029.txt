Unquestionably Mrs Jarley had an inventive genius.  In the midst of
the various devices for attracting visitors to the exhibition,
little Nell was not forgotten.  The light cart in which the Brigand
usually made his perambulations being gaily dressed with flags and
streamers, and the Brigand placed therein, contemplating the
miniature of his beloved as usual, Nell was accommodated with a
seat beside him, decorated with artificial flowers, and in this
state and ceremony rode slowly through the town every morning,
dispersing handbills from a basket, to the sound of drum and
trumpet.  The beauty of the child, coupled with her gentle and
timid bearing, produced quite a sensation in the little country
place.  The Brigand, heretofore a source of exclusive interest in
the streets, became a mere secondary consideration, and to be
important only as a part of the show of which she was the chief
attraction.  Grown-up folks began to be interested in the
bright-eyed girl, and some score of little boys fell desperately in
love, and constantly left enclosures of nuts and apples, directed
in small-text, at the wax-work door.
This desirable impression was not lost on Mrs Jarley, who, lest
Nell should become too cheap, soon sent the Brigand out alone
again, and kept her in the exhibition room, where she described the
figures every half-hour to the great satisfaction of admiring
audiences.  And these audiences were of a very superior
description, including a great many young ladies' boarding-schools,
whose favour Mrs Jarley had been at great pains to conciliate, by
altering the face and costume of Mr Grimaldi as clown to represent
Mr Lindley Murray as he appeared when engaged in the composition of
his English Grammar, and turning a murderess of great renown into
Mrs Hannah More--both of which likenesses were admitted by Miss
Monflathers, who was at the head of the head Boarding and Day
Establishment in the town, and who condescended to take a Private
View with eight chosen young ladies, to be quite startling from
their extreme correctness.  Mr Pitt in a nightcap and bedgown, and
without his boots, represented the poet Cowper with perfect
exactness; and Mary Queen of Scots in a dark wig, white
shirt-collar, and male attire, was such a complete image of Lord
Byron that the young ladies quite screamed when they saw it.  Miss
Monflathers, however, rebuked this enthusiasm, and took occasion to
reprove Mrs Jarley for not keeping her collection more select:
observing that His Lordship had held certain opinions quite
incompatible with wax-work honours, and adding something about a
Dean and Chapter, which Mrs Jarley did not understand.
Although her duties were sufficiently laborious, Nell found in the
lady of the caravan a very kind and considerate person, who had not
only a peculiar relish for being comfortable herself, but for
making everybody about her comfortable also; which latter taste, it
may be remarked, is, even in persons who live in much finer places
than caravans, a far more rare and uncommon one than the first, and
is not by any means its necessary consequence.  As her popularity
procured her various little fees from the visitors on which her
patroness never demanded any toll, and as her grandfather too was
well-treated and useful, she had no cause of anxiety in connexion
with the wax-work, beyond that which sprung from her recollection
of Quilp, and her fears that he might return and one day suddenly
encounter them.
Quilp indeed was a perpetual night-mare to the child, who was
constantly haunted by a vision of his ugly face and stunted figure.
She slept, for their better security, in the room where the
wax-work figures were, and she never retired to this place at night
but she tortured herself--she could not help it--with imagining
a resemblance, in some one or other of their death-like faces, to
the dwarf, and this fancy would sometimes so gain upon her that she
would almost believe he had removed the figure and stood within the
clothes.  Then there were so many of them with their great glassy
eyes--and, as they stood one behind the other all about her bed,
they looked so like living creatures, and yet so unlike in their
grim stillness and silence, that she had a kind of terror of them
for their own sakes, and would often lie watching their dusky
figures until she was obliged to rise and light a candle, or go and
sit at the open window and feel a companionship in the bright
stars.  At these times, she would recall the old house and the
window at which she used to sit alone; and then she would think of
poor Kit and all his kindness, until the tears came into her eyes,
and she would weep and smile together.
Often and anxiously at this silent hour, her thoughts reverted to
her grandfather, and she would wonder how much he remembered of
their former life, and whether he was ever really mindful of the
change in their condition and of their late helplessness and
destitution.  When they were wandering about, she seldom thought of
this, but now she could not help considering what would become of
them if he fell sick, or her own strength were to fail her.  He was
very patient and willing, happy to execute any little task, and
glad to be of use; but he was in the same listless state, with no
prospect of improvement--a mere child--a poor, thoughtless,
vacant creature--a harmless fond old man, susceptible of tender
love and regard for her, and of pleasant and painful impressions,
but alive to nothing more.  It made her very sad to know that this
was so--so sad to see it that sometimes when he sat idly by,
smiling and nodding to her when she looked round, or when he
caressed some little child and carried it to and fro, as he was
fond of doing by the hour together, perplexed by its simple
questions, yet patient under his own infirmity, and seeming almost
conscious of it too, and humbled even before the mind of an infant--
so sad it made her to see him thus, that she would burst into
tears, and, withdrawing into some secret place, fall down upon her
knees and pray that he might be restored.
But, the bitterness of her grief was not in beholding him in this
condition, when he was at least content and tranquil, nor in her
solitary meditations on his altered state, though these were trials
for a young heart.  Cause for deeper and heavier sorrow was yet to
come.
One evening, a holiday night with them, Nell and her grandfather
went out to walk.  They had been rather closely confined for some
days, and the weather being warm, they strolled a long distance.
Clear of the town, they took a footpath which struck through some
pleasant fields, judging that it would terminate in the road they
quitted and enable them to return that way.  It made, however, a
much wider circuit than they had supposed, and thus they were
tempted onward until sunset, when they reached the track of which
they were in search, and stopped to rest.
It had been gradually getting overcast, and now the sky was dark
and lowering, save where the glory of the departing sun piled up
masses of gold and burning fire, decaying embers of which gleamed
here and there through the black veil, and shone redly down upon
the earth.  The wind began to moan in hollow murmurs, as the sun
went down carrying glad day elsewhere; and a train of dull clouds
coming up against it, menaced thunder and lightning.  Large drops
of rain soon began to fall, and, as the storm clouds came sailing
onward, others supplied the void they left behind and spread over
all the sky.  Then was heard the low rumbling of distant thunder,
then the lightning quivered, and then the darkness of an hour
seemed to have gathered in an instant.
Fearful of taking shelter beneath a tree or hedge, the old man and
the child hurried along the high road, hoping to find some house in
which they could seek a refuge from the storm, which had now burst
forth in earnest, and every moment increased in violence.  Drenched
with the pelting rain, confused by the deafening thunder, and
bewildered by the glare of the forked lightning, they would have
passed a solitary house without being aware of its vicinity, had
not a man, who was standing at the door, called lustily to them to
enter.
'Your ears ought to be better than other folks' at any rate, if you
make so little of the chance of being struck blind,' he said,
retreating from the door and shading his eyes with his hands as the
jagged lightning came again.  'What were you going past for, eh?'
he added, as he closed the door and led the way along a passage to
a room behind.
'We didn't see the house, sir, till we heard you calling,' Nell
replied.
'No wonder,' said the man, 'with this lightning in one's eyes,
by-the-by.  You had better stand by the fire here, and dry
yourselves a bit.  You can call for what you like if you want
anything.  If you don't want anything, you are not obliged to give
an order.  Don't be afraid of that.  This is a public-house, that's
all.  The Valiant Soldier is pretty well known hereabouts.'
'Is this house called the Valiant Soldier, Sir?' asked Nell.
'I thought everybody knew that,' replied the landlord.  'Where have
you come from, if you don't know the Valiant Soldier as well as the
church catechism?  This is the Valiant Soldier, by James Groves--
Jem Groves--honest Jem Groves, as is a man of unblemished moral
character, and has a good dry skittle-ground.  If any man has got
anything to say again Jem Groves, let him say it TO Jem Groves, and
Jem Groves can accommodate him with a customer on any terms from
four pound a side to forty.
With these words, the speaker tapped himself on the waistcoat to
intimate that he was the Jem Groves so highly eulogized; sparred
scientifically at a counterfeit Jem Groves, who was sparring at
society in general from a black frame over the chimney-piece; and,
applying a half-emptied glass of spirits and water to his lips,
drank Jem Groves's health.
The night being warm, there was a large screen drawn across the
room, for a barrier against the heat of the fire.  It seemed as if
somebody on the other side of this screen had been insinuating
doubts of Mr Groves's prowess, and had thereby given rise to these
egotistical expressions, for Mr Groves wound up his defiance by
giving a loud knock upon it with his knuckles and pausing for a
reply from the other side.
'There an't many men,' said Mr Groves, no answer being returned,
'who would ventur' to cross Jem Groves under his own roof.  There's
only one man, I know, that has nerve enough for that, and that
man's not a hundred mile from here neither.  But he's worth a dozen
men, and I let him say of me whatever he likes in consequence--he
knows that.'
In return for this complimentary address, a very gruff hoarse voice
bade Mr Groves 'hold his noise and light a candle.'  And the same
voice remarked that the same gentleman 'needn't waste his breath in
brag, for most people knew pretty well what sort of stuff he was
made of.'
'Nell, they're--they're playing cards,' whispered the old man,
suddenly interested.  'Don't you hear them?'
'Look sharp with that candle,' said the voice; 'it's as much as I
can do to see the pips on the cards as it is; and get this shutter
closed as quick as you can, will you?  Your beer will be the worse
for to-night's thunder I expect. --Game!  Seven-and-sixpence to
me, old Isaac.  Hand over.'
'Do you hear, Nell, do you hear them?' whispered the old man again,
with increased earnestness, as the money chinked upon the table.
'I haven't seen such a storm as this,' said a sharp cracked voice
of most disagreeable quality, when a tremendous peal of thunder had
died away, 'since the night when old Luke Withers won thirteen
times running on the red.  We all said he had the Devil's luck and
his own, and as it was the kind of night for the Devil to be out
and busy, I suppose he was looking over his shoulder, if anybody
could have seen him.'
'Ah!' returned the gruff voice; 'for all old Luke's winning through
thick and thin of late years, I remember the time when he was the
unluckiest and unfortunatest of men.  He never took a dice-box in
his hand, or held a card, but he was plucked, pigeoned, and cleaned
out completely.'
'Do you hear what he says?' whispered the old man.  'Do you hear
that, Nell?'
The child saw with astonishment and alarm that his whole appearance
had undergone a complete change.  His face was flushed and eager,
his eyes were strained, his teeth set, his breath came short and
thick, and the hand he laid upon her arm trembled so violently that
she shook beneath its grasp.
'Bear witness,' he muttered, looking upward, 'that I always said
it; that I knew it, dreamed of it, felt it was the truth, and that
it must be so!  What money have we, Nell?  Come!  I saw you with
money yesterday.  What money have we?  Give it to me.'
'No, no, let me keep it, grandfather,' said the frightened child.
'Let us go away from here.  Do not mind the rain.  Pray let us go.'
'Give it to me, I say,' returned the old man fiercely.  'Hush,
hush, don't cry, Nell.  If I spoke sharply, dear, I didn't mean it.
It's for thy good.  I have wronged thee, Nell, but I will right
thee yet, I will indeed.  Where is the money?'
'Do not take it,' said the child.  'Pray do not take it, dear.  For
both our sakes let me keep it, or let me throw it away--better let
me throw it away, than you take it now.  Let us go; do let us go.'
'Give me the money,' returned the old man, 'I must have it.  There--
there--that's my dear Nell.  I'll right thee one day, child,
I'll right thee, never fear!'
She took from her pocket a little purse.  He seized it with the
same rapid impatience which had characterised his speech, and
hastily made his way to the other side of the screen.  It was
impossible to restrain him, and the trembling child followed close
behind.
The landlord had placed a light upon the table, and was engaged in
drawing the curtain of the window.  The speakers whom they had
heard were two men, who had a pack of cards and some silver money
between them, while upon the screen itself the games they had
played were scored in chalk.  The man with the rough voice was a
burly fellow of middle age, with large black whiskers, broad
cheeks, a coarse wide mouth, and bull neck, which was pretty freely
displayed as his shirt collar was only confined by a loose red
neckerchief.  He wore his hat, which was of a brownish-white, and
had beside him a thick knotted stick.  The other man, whom his
companion had called Isaac, was of a more slender figure--
stooping, and high in the shoulders--with a very ill-favoured
face, and a most sinister and villainous squint.
'Now old gentleman,' said Isaac, looking round.  'Do you know
either of us?  This side of the screen is private, sir.'
'No offence, I hope,' returned the old man.
'But by G--, sir, there is offence,' said the other, interrupting
him, 'when you intrude yourself upon a couple of gentlemen who are
particularly engaged.'
'I had no intention to offend,' said the old man, looking anxiously
at the cards.  'I thought that--'
'But you had no right to think, sir,' retorted the other.  'What
the devil has a man at your time of life to do with thinking?'
'Now bully boy,' said the stout man, raising his eyes from his
cards for the first time, 'can't you let him speak?'
The landlord, who had apparently resolved to remain neutral until
he knew which side of the question the stout man would espouse,
chimed in at this place with 'Ah, to be sure, can't you let him
speak, Isaac List?'
'Can't I let him speak,' sneered Isaac in reply, mimicking as
nearly as he could, in his shrill voice, the tones of the landlord.
'Yes, I can let him speak, Jemmy Groves.'
'Well then, do it, will you?' said the landlord.
Mr List's squint assumed a portentous character, which seemed to
threaten a prolongation of this controversy, when his companion,
who had been looking sharply at the old man, put a timely stop to
it.
'Who knows,' said he, with a cunning look, 'but the gentleman may
have civilly meant to ask if he might have the honour to take a
hand with us!'
'I did mean it,' cried the old man.  'That is what I mean.  That is
what I want now!'
'I thought so,' returned the same man.  'Then who knows but the
gentleman, anticipating our objection to play for love, civilly
desired to play for money?'
The old man replied by shaking the little purse in his eager hand,
and then throwing it down upon the table, and gathering up the
cards as a miser would clutch at gold.
'Oh!  That indeed,' said Isaac; 'if that's what the gentleman
meant, I beg the gentleman's pardon.  Is this the gentleman's
little purse?  A very pretty little purse.  Rather a light purse,'
added Isaac, throwing it into the air and catching it dexterously,
'but enough to amuse a gentleman for half an hour or so.'
'We'll make a four-handed game of it, and take in Groves,' said the
stout man.  'Come, Jemmy.'
The landlord, who conducted himself like one who was well used to
such little parties, approached the table and took his seat.  The
child, in a perfect agony, drew her grandfather aside, and implored
him, even then, to come away.
'Come; and we may be so happy,' said the child.
'We WILL be happy,' replied the old man hastily.  'Let me go, Nell.
The means of happiness are on the cards and the dice.  We must rise
from little winnings to great.  There's little to be won here; but
great will come in time.  I shall but win back my own, and it's all
for thee, my darling.'
'God help us!' cried the child.  'Oh! what hard fortune brought us
here?'
'Hush!' rejoined the old man laying his hand upon her mouth,
'Fortune will not bear chiding.  We must not reproach her, or she
shuns us; I have found that out.'
'Now, mister,' said the stout man.  'If you're not coming yourself,
give us the cards, will you?'
'I am coming,' cried the old man.  'Sit thee down, Nell, sit thee
down and look on.  Be of good heart, it's all for thee--all--
every penny.  I don't tell them, no, no, or else they wouldn't
play, dreading the chance that such a cause must give me.  Look at
them.  See what they are and what thou art.  Who doubts that we
must win!'
'The gentleman has thought better of it, and isn't coming,' said
Isaac, making as though he would rise from the table.  'I'm sorry
the gentleman's daunted--nothing venture, nothing have--but the
gentleman knows best.'
'Why I am ready.  You have all been slow but me,' said the old man.
'I wonder who is more anxious to begin than I.'
As he spoke he drew a chair to the table; and the other three
closing round it at the same time, the game commenced.
The child sat by, and watched its progress with a troubled mind.
Regardless of the run of luck, and mindful only of the desperate
passion which had its hold upon her grandfather, losses and gains
were to her alike.  Exulting in some brief triumph, or cast down by
a defeat, there he sat so wild and restless, so feverishly and
intensely anxious, so terribly eager, so ravenous for the paltry
stakes, that she could have almost better borne to see him dead.
And yet she was the innocent cause of all this torture, and he,
gambling with such a savage thirst for gain as the most insatiable
gambler never felt, had not one selfish thought!
On the contrary, the other three--knaves and gamesters by their
trade--while intent upon their game, were yet as cool and quiet as
if every virtue had been centered in their breasts.  Sometimes one
would look up to smile to another, or to snuff the feeble candle,
or to glance at the lightning as it shot through the open window
and fluttering curtain, or to listen to some louder peal of thunder
than the rest, with a kind of momentary impatience, as if it put
him out; but there they sat, with a calm indifference to everything
but their cards, perfect philosophers in appearance, and with no
greater show of passion or excitement than if they had been
made of stone.
The storm had raged for full three hours; the lightning had grown
fainter and less frequent; the thunder, from seeming to roll and
break above their heads, had gradually died away into a deep hoarse
distance; and still the game went on, and still the anxious child
was quite forgotten.
