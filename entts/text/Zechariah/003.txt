1 He then showed me the high priest Joshua, standing before the angel of Yahweh, with Satan standing on his right to accuse him.
2 The angel of Yahweh said to Satan, 'May Yahweh rebuke you, Satan! May Yahweh rebuke you, since he has made Jerusalem his choice. Is not this man a brand snatched from the fire?'
3 Now Joshua was dressed in dirty clothes as he stood before the angel.
4 The latter then spoke as follows to those who were standing before him, 'Take off his dirty clothesand dress him in splendid robes
5 and put a clean turban on his head.' So they put a clean turban on his head and dressed him in clean clothes, while the angel of Yahweh stood byand said, 'You see, I have taken your guilt away.'
6 The angel of Yahweh then made this declaration to Joshua,
7 'Yahweh Sabaoth says this, "If you walk in my ways and keep my ordinances, you shall govern my house, you shall watch over my courts, and I will give you free access among those in attendance here.
8 'So listen, High Priest Joshua, you and the colleagues over whom you preside -- for they are an omen of things to come -- for now I shall bring in my servant the Branch, and I shall remove this country's guilt in a single day.
9 For this is the stone which I have put before Joshua, a stone on which are seven eyes; and I myself shall cut the inscription on it -- Yahweh Sabaoth declares."
10 On that day -- Yahweh Sabaoth declares -- invite each other to come under your vine and your fig tree." '
