1 I see another evil under the sun, which goes hard with people:
2 suppose someone has received from God riches, property, honours -- nothing at all left to wish for; but God does not give the chance to enjoy them, and some stranger enjoys them. This is futile, and grievous suffering too.
3 Or take someone who has had a hundred children and lived for many years, and, having reached old age, has never enjoyed the good things of life and has not even got a tomb; it seems to me, a still-born child is happier.
4 In futility it came, into darkness it departs, and in darkness will its name be buried.
5 It has never so much as seen or known the sun; all the same, it will rest more easily than that person,
6 who would never have known the good things of life, even by living a thousand years twice over. Do we not all go to the same place in the end?
7 All toil is for the mouth, yet the appetite is never satisfied.
8 What advantage has the wise over the fool? And what of the pauper who knows how to behave in society?
9 Better the object seen than the sting of desire: for the latter too is futile and chasing after the wind.
10 What has been is already defined -- we know what people are: They cannot bring to justice one who is stronger than themselves.
11 The more we say, the more futile it is: what good can we derive from it?
12 And who knows what is best for someone during life, during the days of futile life which are spent like a shadow? Who can tell anyone what will happen after him under the sun?
