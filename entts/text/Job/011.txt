1 Zophar of Naamath spoke next. He said:
2 Is babbling to go without an answer? Is wordiness a proof of uprightness?
3 Do you think your talking strikes people dumb, will you jeer with no one to refute you?
4 These were your words, 'My conduct is pure, in your eyes I am free of blame!'
5 Will no one let God speak, open his lips and give you answer,
6 show you the secrets of wisdom which put all cleverness to shame? Then you would realise that God is calling you to account for your sin.
7 Can you claim to fathom the depth of God, can you reach the limit of Shaddai?
8 It is higher than the heavens: what can you do? It is deeper than Sheol: what can you know?
9 It would be longer to measure than the earth and broader than the sea.
10 If he intervenes to close or convoke the assembly, who is to prevent him?
11 He knows how deceptive human beings are, and he sees their misdeeds too, and marks them well.
12 Hence empty-headed people would do well to study sense and people who behave like wild donkeys to let themselves be tamed.
13 Come, reconsider your attitude, stretch out your hands towards him!
14 If you repudiate the sin which you have doubtless committed and do not allow wickedness to live on in your tents,
15 you will be able to raise an unsullied face, unwavering and free from fear,
16 for you will forget about your misery, thinking of it only as a flood that passed long ago.
17 Then begins an existence more radiant than noon, and the very darkness will be bright as morning.
18 Confident because there is hope; after your troubles, you will sleep secure.
19 When you lie down to rest, no one will trouble you, and many will seek your favour.
20 But as for the wicked, their eyes are weary, there is no refuge for them; their only hope is to breathe their last.
