1 Bildad of Shuah spoke next. He said:
2 What sovereignty, what awe, is his who creates peace on his heights!
3 Who can count his armies? Against whom does his lightning not surge forth?
4 Could anyone think God regards him as virtuous, the child of woman as pure!
6 How much less a human, this maggot, the child of man, this worm!
