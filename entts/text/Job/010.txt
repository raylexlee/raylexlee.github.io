1 Since I have lost all taste for life, I shall give free rein to my complaining; I shall let my embittered soul speak out.
2 I shall say to God, 'Do not condemn me, tell me what your case is against me.
3 Is it right for you to attack me, in contempt for what you yourself have made, thus abetting the schemes of the wicked?
4 Are your eyes mere human eyes, do you see as human beings see?
5 Are you mortal like human beings? do your years pass as human days pass?
6 You, who enquire into my faults and investigate my sins,
7 you know very well that I am innocent, and that no one can rescue me from your grasp.
8 Your hands having shaped and created me, now you change your mind and mean to destroy me!
9 Having made me, remember, as though of clay, now you mean to turn me back into dust!
10 Did you not pour me out like milk, and then let me thicken like curds,
11 clothe me with skin and flesh, and weave me of bone and sinew?
12 In your love you gave me life, and in your care watched over my every breath.
13 Yet, all the while, you had a secret plan: I know that you were biding your time
14 to see if I should sin and then not acquit me of my faults.
15 Woe to me, if I am guilty; even if I am upright, I dare not lift my head, so overwhelmed with shame and drunk with pain am I!
16 Proud as a lion, you hunt me down, multiplying your exploits at my expense,
17 attacking me again and again, your fury against me ever increasing, your troops assailing me, wave after wave.
18 Why did you bring me out of the womb? I should have perished then, unseen by any eye,
19 a being that had never been, to be carried from womb to grave.
20 The days of my life are few enough: turn your eyes away, leave me a little joy,
21 before I go to the place of no return, to the land of darkness and shadow dark as death,
22 where dimness and disorder hold sway, and light itself is like dead of night.
