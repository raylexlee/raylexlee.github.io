1 Job spoke next. He said:
2 To one so weak, what a help you are, for the arm that is powerless, what a rescuer!
3 What excellent advice you give the unlearned, you are never at a loss for a helpful suggestion!
4 For whom are these words of yours intended and whence comes that wit you are now displaying?
5 The Shadows tremble underneath the earth, the waters and their denizens are afraid.
6 Before his eyes, Sheol is bare, Perdition itself is uncovered.
7 He it was who spread the North above the void and poised the earth on nothingness.
8 He fastens up the waters in his clouds, without the clouds giving way under their weight.
9 He covers the face of the full moon, spreading his cloud across it.
10 He has traced a ring on the surface of the waters, at the boundary between light and dark.
11 The pillars of the heavens tremble, awe-struck at his threats.
12 By his power, he has whipped up the Sea, by his skill, he has crushed Rahab.
13 His breath has made the heavens luminous, his hand transfixed the Fleeing Serpent.
14 This is only a fraction of what he has done and all we catch of it is the feeblest echo. But who can conceive the thunder of his power?
