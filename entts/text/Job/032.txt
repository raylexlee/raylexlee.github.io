1 These three men stopped arguing with Job, because he was convinced of his uprightness.
2 But Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the clan of Ram, became very angry. He fumed with rage against Job for thinking that he was right and God was wrong;
3 and he was equally angry with the three friends for giving up the argument and thus putting God in the wrong.
4 While they and Job were talking, Elihu had waited, because they were older than he was;
5 but when he saw that the three men had not another word to say in answer, his anger burst out.
6 And Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite began to speak. He said: I am still young, and you are old, so I was shy and hesitant to tell you what I know.
7 I thought, 'Age ought to speak, advancing years will convey wisdom.'
8 There is, you see, a spirit residing in humanity, the breath of God conferring intelligence.
9 Great age does not give wisdom, nor seniority fair judgement.
10 And so I ask you for a hearing; now it is my turn to tell what I know.
11 Up to now, I was hanging on your words, I paid attention to your arguments as each of you chose his words.
12 I paid very close attention; and I see that none of you has confounded Job, not one of you has refuted what he says.
13 So do not say, 'We have found wisdom; our teaching is divine and not human.'
14 I am not going to follow the same line of argument; my reply to Job will be couched in different terms.
15 They are nonplussed for an answer, words have failed them.
16 I have been waiting. Since they do not speak, since they have given up the argument,
17 now I shall have my say, my turn has come to say what I know.
18 For I am full of words and forced to speak by a spirit within me;
19 within me, it feels like new wine seeking a vent, bursting out of new wine-skins.
20 To gain relief, I must speak, I must open my lips and reply.
21 I shall not take anyone's side, I shall not flatter anyone.
22 I do not know how to flatter -- or my Creator would make short work of me.
