1 Now Yahweh ordained that a great fish should swallow Jonah; and Jonah remained in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights.
2 From the belly of the fish, Jonah prayed to Yahweh, his God; he said:
3 Out of my distress I cried to Yahweh and he answered me, from the belly of Sheol I cried out; you heard my voice!
4 For you threw me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the floods closed round me. All your waves and billows passed over me;
5 then I thought, 'I am banished from your sight; how shall I ever see your holy Temple again?'
6 The waters round me rose to my neck, the deep was closing round me, seaweed twining round my head.
7 To the roots of the mountains, I sank into the underworld, and its bars closed round me for ever. But you raised my life from the Pit, Yahweh my God!
8 When my soul was growing ever weaker, Yahweh, I remembered you, and my prayer reached you in your holy Temple.
9 Some abandon their faithful love by worshipping false gods,
10 but I shall sacrifice to you with songs of praise. The vow I have made I shall fulfil! Salvation comes from Yahweh!
11 Yahweh spoke to the fish, which then vomited Jonah onto the dry land.
