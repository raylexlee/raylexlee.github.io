1 Wisdom has built herself a house, she has hewn her seven pillars,
2 she has slaughtered her beasts, drawn her wine, she has laid her table.
3 She has despatched her maidservants and proclaimed from the heights above the city,
4 'Who is simple? Let him come this way.' To the fool she says,
5 'Come and eat my bread, drink the wine which I have drawn!
6 Leave foolishness behind and you will live, go forwards in the ways of perception.'
7 Reprove a mocker and you attract contempt, rebuke the wicked and you attract dishonour.
8 Do not rebuke the mocker, he will hate you. Rebuke the wise and he will love you for it.
9 Be open with the wise, he grows wiser still, teach the upright, he will gain yet more.
10 The first principle of wisdom is the fear of Yahweh, What God's holy ones know -- this is understanding.
11 For by me your days will be multiplied, and your years of life increased.
12 Are you wise? You are wise to your own good. A mocker? The burden is yours alone.
13 A silly woman acts on impulse, is foolish and knows nothing.
14 She sits at the door of her house, on a throne high up in the city,
15 calling to the passers-by, who are walking straight past on their way,
16 'Who is simple? Turn aside, come over here.' To the fool she says,
17 'Stolen waters are sweet, and bread tastes better when eaten in secret.'
18 But the fool does not know that this is where the Shades are and that her guests are already in the vales of Sheol.
