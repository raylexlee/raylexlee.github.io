1 At many moments in the past and by many means, God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets; but
2 in our time, the final days, he has spoken to us in the person of his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things and through whom he made the ages.
3 He is the reflection of God's glory and bears the impress of God's own being, sustaining all things by his powerful command; and now that he has purged sins away, he has taken his seat at the right hand of the divine Majesty on high.
4 So he is now as far above the angels as the title which he has inherited is higher than their own name.
5 To which of the angels, then, has God ever said: You are my Son, today I have fathered you, or: I shall be a father to him and he a son to me?
6 Again, when he brings the First-born into the world, he says: Let all the angels of God pay him homage.
7 To the angels, he says: appointing the winds his messengers and flames of fire his servants,
8 but to the Son he says: Your throne, God, is for ever and ever; and: the sceptre of his kingdom is a sceptre of justice;
9 you love uprightness and detest evil. This is why God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness, as none of your rivals.
10 And again: Long ago, Lord, you laid earth's foundations, the heavens are the work of your hands.
11 They pass away but you remain, they all wear out like a garment.
12 Like a cloak you will roll them up, like a garment, and they will be changed. But you never alter and your years are unending.
13 To which of the angels has God ever said: Take your seat at my right hand till I have made your enemies your footstool?
14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?
