1 'After this I shall pour out my spirit on all humanity. Your sons and daughters shall prophesy, your old people shall dream dreams, and your young people see visions.
2 Even on the slaves, men and women, shall I pour out my spirit in those days.
3 I shall show portents in the sky and on earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke.'
4 The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the Day comes, that great and terrible Day.
5 All who call on the name of Yahweh will be saved, for on Mount Zion will be those who have escaped, as Yahweh has said, and in Jerusalem a remnant whom Yahweh is calling.
