1 The word that the prophet Jeremiah addressed to Baruch son of Neriah when the latter wrote these words down in a book at Jeremiah's dictation in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah,
2 'This is what Yahweh God of Israel says about you, Baruch!
3 "You have been thinking: what disaster for me, and Yahweh has added further grief to my troubles! I am worn out with groaning, and find no relief!"
4 Say to him as follows, "Yahweh says this: Now I am knocking down what I have built, am uprooting what I have planted, over the whole country!
5 And you ask for special treatment! Do not ask, for I am now going to bring disaster on all humanity, Yahweh declares, but you I shall allow to escape with your life, wherever you may go." '
