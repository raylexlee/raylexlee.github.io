1 Words of Amos one of the shepherds of Tekoa. The visions he had about Israel, in the time of Uzziah king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
2 He said: Yahweh roars from Zion, and makes himself heard from Jerusalem; the shepherds' pastures mourn, and the crown of Carmel dries up.
3 Yahweh says this: For the three crimes, the four crimes of Damascus, I have made my decree and will not relent: because they have threshed Gilead with iron threshing-sledges,
4 I shall send fire down on the House of Hazael to devour the palaces of Ben-Hadad;
5 I shall break the gate-bar of Damascus, I shall destroy the inhabitant of Bikath-Aven, the holder of the sceptre in Beth-Eden, and the people of Aram will be deported to Kir, Yahweh says.
6 Yahweh says this: For the three crimes, the four crimes of Gaza, I have made my decree and will not relent: because they have deported entire nations as slaves to Edom,
7 I shall send fire down on the walls of Gaza to devour its palaces;
8 I shall destroy the inhabitant of Ashdod, the holder of the sceptre in Ashkelon; I shall turn my hand against Ekron and the remnant of the Philistines will perish, says the Lord Yahweh.
9 Yahweh says this: For the three crimes, the four crimes of Tyre, I have made my decree and will not relent: because they have handed hosts of captives over to Edom, heedless of a covenant of brotherhood,
10 I shall send fire down on the walls of Tyre to devour its palaces.
11 Yahweh says this: For the three crimes, the four crimes of Edom, I have made my decree and will not relent: because he has pursued his brother with the sword, because he has stifled any sense of pity, and perpetually nursed his anger and constantly cherished his rage,
12 I shall send fire down on Teman to devour the palaces of Bozrah.
13 Yahweh says this: For the three crimes, the four crimes of the Ammonites, I have made my decree and will not relent: because they have disembowelled the pregnant women of Gilead in order to extend their own frontiers,
14 I shall light a fire against the walls of Rabbah to devour its palaces amid war cries on the day of battle, in a whirlwind on the day of storm,
15 and their king shall go into captivity, he and his chief men with him, says Yahweh.
