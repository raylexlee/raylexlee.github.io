1 Proclamation about Moab: Laid waste in a night, Ar-Moab lies silent; Laid waste in a night, Kir-Moab lies silent.
2 The daughter of Dibon has climbed to the high places to weep; on Nebo and in Medeba Moab laments. Every head shaven, every beard cut off,
3 they wear sackcloth in their streets; on their roofs and in their squares, everyone is lamenting and collapsing in tears.
4 Heshbon and Elealeh are crying out in distress, their voices can be heard as far as Jahaz. That is why the warriors of Moab are shivering, his soul trembles at the sound.
5 His heart cries out in distress for Moab, whose fugitives are already at Zoar, nearly at Eglath-Shelishiyah. They climb the slope of Luhith, weeping as they go; on the road to Horonaim they utter heart-rending cries.
6 The Waters of Nimrim have become a waste land, the grass dried up, the plants withered away, nothing green any more.
7 That is why they are carrying what they could save of their stores across the Ravine of the Willows.
8 For the cry for help re-echoes round the territory of Moab; their wailing, right to Eglaim, to Beer-Elim, their wailing;
9 Dimon's waters are swollen with blood, and I have worse in store for Dimon: a lion for those of Moab who survive, for those left on its soil.
